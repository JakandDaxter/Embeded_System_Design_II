# Embeded_System_Design_II

You are to create a PWM module in VHDL that accepts a period and duty cycle and generates a PWM pulse train output. The module shall be fully verified via simulation in Modelsim. Verify the module for all corner cases. Assume the input clock frequency is 50 MHz.
Requirements for the PWM module:


• shall have an enable pulse.

• shall be able to control both the duty cycle and the period of the PWM pulse train

• shall use basic entity inputs and not use ‘generics’ for the period and duty inputs.
