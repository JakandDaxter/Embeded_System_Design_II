This project based course is the culmination of the curriculum capstone experience for the Computer Engineering Technology program. 

This course will be focused around a project that includes:

- product ideation
- project/resource management techniques
- system level specification
- modeling
- partition and design
- team collaboration and communication
- best documentation practices
- industry level coding practices
- hardware and software co-design methodologies
- design reuse and intellectual property creation
- design verification and validation
- design sign-off

Students, Upon  Successful Completion  of the  Course, Will  Have an  Industry-like Embedded  System Product  Design Experience,
Starting by  Developing the  Vision for  a Product, Including  the Voice  of the Customer,  and Progress  Through the  Phases To
Develop a  Complete Product Prototype With  Professional Documentation. in Addition  the Students Will: Track  and Present Their
Progress; Participate in  Design and Code Reviews; Demonstrate  Their Product and Highlight Product Differentiation.  at the End
Of the  Course Students  Will Give a  Formal Presentation,  Product Demonstration, Deliver  Professional Documentation,  go Over
